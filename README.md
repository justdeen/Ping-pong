## ⚙️How the Code Works
The game uses JavaScript event listeners to update the scores and check for a winner. Here's a high-level breakdown:

1. The game stores HTML elements in JavaScript variables for easy access.
2. Global variables track the current score, target score, and player scores.
3. Event listeners on the player buttons update scores and check for a winner.
4. The winner is declared when the sum of both player scores reaches or exceeds the target score.
